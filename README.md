## 项目简介
Urban public spaces such as streets, parks, and campuses face persistent challenges in maintaining cleanliness due to scattered waste including plastic bottles, cigarette butts, leaves, broken glass, and snack debris. Manual cleaning is inefficient, poses safety risks, and cannot keep up with high-frequency waste accumulation. Existing mechanical sweepers often fail to collect diverse waste types or operate effectively in crowded or narrow spaces. This proposal outlines the development of an autonomous, multi-function waste collection robot capable of simultaneously picking up discrete items (e.g., bottles and butts) and sweeping residual debris. Key features include a dual-mode actuation system, onboard compression to increase storage capacity, and autonomous navigation in pedestrian-dense environments. The robot aims to achieve a collection rate of ≥150 items/hour, ≥90% sweeping coverage, and ≥6 hours of continuous operation per charge, all within a compact form factor (height ≤80 cm) suitable for public spaces.

Public area cleanliness is a growing concern in urban environments. Traditional manual cleaning methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and expose workers to hazards such as broken glass and sharp debris. Existing mechanical solutions are often limited to sweeping leaves and light debris, lacking the capability to collect varied waste types like plastic bottles and cigarette butts. Moreover, many devices are too large for narrow walkways or crowded areas, and none offer integrated compression to extend operational range.

This project aims to design and prototype an autonomous robot that combines targeted grasping with broad-area sweeping and compression. The system will use computer vision and lidar to navigate and identify waste, a robotic arm for selective pickup, and a brush-vacuum system for residual cleaning. A compression mechanism will reduce waste volume by ≥60%, enabling longer operation between empties. This approach addresses both efficiency and safety in public space maintenance.
